## Technical Competencies & Project Highlights

My approach to data analysis is built on a foundation of rigor, reproducibility, and clear communication. I specialize in using modern tools to manage the entire data lifecycle, from initial cleaning to generating automated, publication-ready reports.

### Data Wrangling & Statistical Programming

I have extensive experience in transforming complex, raw datasets into clean, analysis-ready formats. My primary tools are **R** (leveraging packages like `` `dplyr` ``, `` `tidyr` ``, and `` `lubridate` ``) and **STATA**. This ensures data integrity and prepares the groundwork for robust statistical analysis.

### Advanced Data Visualization

I create compelling narratives from data by developing both static and interactive visualizations. I use **`ggplot2`** to produce high-quality, customizable plots for scientific publications and **`Plotly`** to build dynamic dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore the data for themselves.

### Automated & Reproducible Reporting

I am highly skilled in creating efficient, automated reporting systems using **R Markdown** and **`knitr`**. By parameterizing reports, I can automatically generate hundreds of customized outputs (e.g., for different regions or timeframes), ensuring consistency and saving significant time.

### Scientific Statistical Analysis

My work is grounded in sound statistical methodology. I conduct a wide range of analyses for scientific papers, including descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression models, survival analysis, and mixed-effects models, using both **R** and **STATA**.

### Project Spotlight: Main Statistician for STEPS2021 & IQCAMP

In my role as the main statistician for major national surveys like STEPS2021 and IQCAMP, I was responsible for the entire data pipeline. My key contributions included:

* Leading the design, cleaning, and analysis of large-scale survey data.
* Developing a fully automated reporting generator with **R Markdown** that produced tailored statistical summaries and visualizations for each province. This system provided critical, timely insights to stakeholders across the country.
* Conducting the definitive statistical analyses that formed the basis of final reports and scientific publications.
