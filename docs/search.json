    "text": "Technical Competencies & Project Highlights\nMy approach to data analysis is built on a foundation of rigor, reproducibility, and clear communication. I specialize in using modern tools to manage the entire data lifecycle, from initial cleaning to generating automated, publication-ready reports.\n\nData Wrangling & Statistical Programming\nI have extensive experience in transforming complex, raw datasets into clean, analysis-ready formats. My primary tools are R (leveraging packages like `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `lubridate`) and STATA. This ensures data integrity and prepares the groundwork for robust statistical analysis.\n\n\nAdvanced Data Visualization\nI create compelling narratives from data by developing both static and interactive visualizations. I use ggplot2 to produce high-quality, customizable plots for scientific publications and Plotly to build dynamic dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore the data for themselves.\n\n\nAutomated & Reproducible Reporting\nI am highly skilled in creating efficient, automated reporting systems using R Markdown and knitr. By parameterizing reports, I can automatically generate hundreds of customized outputs (e.g., for different regions or timeframes), ensuring consistency and saving significant time.\n\n\nScientific Statistical Analysis\nMy work is grounded in sound statistical methodology. I conduct a wide range of analyses for scientific papers, including descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression models, survival analysis, and mixed-effects models, using both R and STATA.\n\n\n\nProject Spotlight: Main Statistician for STEPS2021 & IQCAMP\nIn my role as the main statistician for major national surveys like STEPS2021 and IQCAMP, I was responsible for the entire data pipeline. My key contributions included:\n\nLeading the design, cleaning, and analysis of large-scale survey data.\nDeveloping a fully automated reporting generator with R Markdown that produced tailored statistical summaries and visualizations for each province. This system provided critical, timely insights to stakeholders across the country.\nConducting the definitive statistical analyses that formed the basis of final reports and scientific publications."
