# **Naser Ahmadi**

**Biostatistician and Data Analyst.**

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
A seasoned Public Health Data Analyst with an MSc in Biostatistics and over 12 years of experience transforming complex data into actionable public health insights. My career is highlighted by more than seven years at the Non-communicable Diseases Research Center, where I played a key role in national and international projects funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Iran's Ministry of Health.

My expertise lies in the complete data lifecycle: from meticulous data wrangling and advanced statistical analysis to creating compelling visualizations and interactive dashboards with R/Shiny and Power BI.

Beyond my technical skills, I am a passionate educator and an expert in capacity-building, having designed and delivered professional training on R and STATA. I am a collaborative, detail-oriented problem-solver, eager to apply my skills to new challenges and contribute to data-driven decision-making in the health sector.
